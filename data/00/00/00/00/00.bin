    Submerged is a third-person combat-free game in which you explore a mysterious
    flooded city and discover the beauty of desolation in vast outdoor environments.
    You take on the role of Miku, a young girl who has brought her wounded brother
    to the city in their small fishing boat. Navigate the flooded city streets by
    boat, scale the drowned buildings, and use your telescope to scour the city
    for the supplies needed to save your dying sibling. As you explore the city
    at your own pace, you encounter the habitat that flourishes in this colorful
    place and discover hidden objects that piece together the story of a broken
    world and a broken family.

    Game Features
    Vast outdoor environments with a rich, colorful and vibrant habitat present
    the player with a beautiful place to linger during the day or night, and
    encounter the mysterious remnants that watch you from the rooftops.
    
    A serene and relaxing game experience; take your time to enjoy the sunrise
    and beautiful vistas, listen to the sound of the ocean, or observe the
    playfulness of the creatures that inhabit this place. There is only one
    pace in this game and that’s your own.
    
    Discover the hidden objects that piece together the story of redemption,
    sacrifice and determination, and learn more about how the city came to be
    this way.

    Cruise through the city streets in your small powered fishing boat, using
    your telescope to identify which of the various buildings contain supplies
    and mark them on your map.

    Discover the best path to the objects you spotted from afar. Dock your boat
    at tall buildings and landmarks and climb the vines, ladders, ledges and
    pipes as increasingly difficult navigation puzzles.

    Developed by an independent studio based in Australia, consisting of AAA
    veterans who have previously worked on the BioShock series, with music
    from BAFTA award winning composer Jeff van Dyck.
